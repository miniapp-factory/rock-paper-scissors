Create a simple 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' game in a single HTML file featuring a modern, centered layout with a dark background. I need three large circular buttons with emojis for Rock, Paper, and Scissors; when clicked, the computer randomly picks one. Display the current Player vs Computer score at the top and show the result of each round clearly with large text like 'You Win!', 'You Lose!', or 'Draw!', along with the computer's choice.
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

The following files in your repository are the ones that will need to be edited or added to implement the Rock‑Paper‑Scissors game, generate the app logo, and update the metadata title and description:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to import and render the new game component.  
2. `mini-app/components/rock-paper-scissors.tsx` – new component that contains the game logic and UI.  
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to change the `title` and `description` values.  
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – new file that describes the logo to be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes.

A stylized logo for a Rock Paper Scissors game: a dark circular background with three bright symbols representing rock (a gray stone), paper (a white sheet), and scissors (a silver pair of scissors) arranged around a central circle. The symbols are in contrasting colors: gray stone, white paper, and silver scissors. The background is dark navy blue with a subtle gradient and a subtle drop shadow. The text "RPS" in bold white is centered in the middle of the circle.
